For a good discussion of this, see [Ted Neward](https://twitter.com/tedneward)'s [Speaking Tips: How to Write Good Proposals](http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/speaking-tips-proposals/).

## The title

Part of a 'good' title, is having a title that is well-suited to the conference you are applying to.

Conference organiser [Mark Sellors](https://twitter.com/sellorm) suggests:

> The big thing here is to choose a title that is a) interesting and b) appropriate for the conference to which you’re submitting. For instance, submitting a talk called "Joint quantum chemical and polarizable molecular mechanics investigation of formate complexes with penta- and hexahydrated Zn2+" to a non-academic focussed conference is not going to win you any points. Outside of the academic world, this title is not memorable and does not fit well on the conference schedule. Try to be brief and convey the main theme of your talk and if your title is memorable in some way, so much the better.

Speaker and Program Committee member for Devoxx conferences, [Roy van Rijn](https://twitter.com/royvanrijn) suggests running title ideas by a friend:
> One thing I always do it throw about 10 different title ideas against other speakers and discus what sticks/interests them.

## The abstract

[Roy van Rijn](https://twitter.com/royvanrijn):
> I don't have any particular thoughts about writing abstracts, for me it is just trying to:
- Write about what I want to talk about (braindump)
- Get people interested in that topic
And, from the point of view of being on the program committee:

> Too much buzzwords without context for me is an alarm-trigger, also company names are a turn-off, I don't want sponsor talks.
